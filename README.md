## Issues with No Fix / Planned Features

> [!NOTE]
> These are known issues or upcoming features that are being worked on.

Script editor bugs:
- Switching tabs clears active text
- Tab autofill doesn't work
- Cannot rename files/tabs directly

Planned:
- Multi-instance is not yet supported. Might work via third-party tools, but official support is coming soon.

---

## Initialization failed: Unexpected Error

- Close swift if open
- If you are using a vpn disable it. If you are not using a [vpn](#what-vpn-to-use), enable one
- Relaunch swift
- If swift has launched fully without that error, you can now disable ur vpn

---

## How do I downgrade?

> [!CAUTION]
> Downgrading might be detected, likely not but still a risk of being banned. Just as there is a risk with exploiting, you have been warned. Use alts!

You might want to downgrade if Swift hasn‚Äôt updated yet. Here‚Äôs how:

- Go to https://rdd.latte.to/
- set the version hash you want
- Download and unzip the file  
- Open `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` inside the folder  
- Inject as normal

---

## How do I disable my antivirus?

> [!TIP]
> Swift often triggers false positives because of how it operates. Disabling antivirus or adding exceptions is necessary.

### Windows Defender (default on all Windows PCs)

- [Windows 10 Disable Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GgtAxWxhMQ)  
- [Windows 11 Disable Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0OTed9c_GQ)

### Add Exceptions Instead (Recommended)
- [Windows 10 Exceptions Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BonLkFNnO9w)  
- [Windows 11 Exceptions Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiNGnX5dYg)

Add these paths:
- Your Swift folder
- `%temp%\Ckfn1k59vk.exe`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The file (`Ckfn1k59vk.exe`) is used by Swift. If it's blocked, you‚Äôll get the [Injection Timeout](#injection-timeout) error.

Using McAfee, Norton, AVG, Avast? Just search how to disable or make folder exceptions for your antivirus on YouTube.

---

## Key system Issues

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **will** encounter key system issues on certain browsers. Please use microsoft edge in an incognito window, this solves most issues

### Swift website won‚Äôt load?
- Use [Warp VPN](#what-vpn-to-use)

> [!NOTE]
> If you obtain a key using a VPN, you **MUST** redeem the key using the same VPN. After that, you can turn it off.

### Lootlabs issues?
- Disable VPN  
- Use [Quad9 DNS](https://youtube.com/watch?v=aujUl3yt6nM)  
- Refresh stuck tasks  
- If given an article task, click inside **the same tab** that opens.

---

## Fatal Error

Close Swift and Roblox completely.

- Launch Swift first  
- Then launch Roblox

---

## Injection Timeout

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inject **only** on homescreen, not in a game</br>
> If you get this error but dont crash, try to inject multiple times</br>
> Make sure [antivirus is disabled and exceptions are added](#how-do-i-disable-my-antivirus). Defender can silently delete `Ckfn1k59vk.exe`.

- [Restore the EXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWaw1XZJj58)  
- [Add an Exception](#how-do-i-disable-my-antivirus)

Open roblox, go to more, then about
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9af3d40-d604-4c20-b9a0-a6f230f40b1a)</br>
Compare this information with someone who isn't getting the error. As you may be on the wrong version
If you are, update and compare again. Also make sure channel is production!

- Open cmd prompt (windows key +r, type cmd, hit enter)
- Paste the following `if exist "%temp%\Ckfn1k59vk.exe" (echo File exists) else (echo File not found)`, and hit enter
- If the file dosen't exist, use a [vpn](#what-vpn-to-use) close swift, rerun
- After swift fully opens run the cmd again to see if the file is now there
- If it is, you can now turn off the vpn, restart swift, and use as normal.

## Module not found

- Make sure [antivirus is disabled](#how-do-i-disable-my-antivirus)
- Close both Swift & Roblox
- Delete `Swift-Module.dll`
- Relaunch Swift, then Roblox

---

## Failed to relocate module

- Ensure [antivirus is disabled](#how-do-i-disable-my-antivirus)  
- Close both Swift and Roblox
- Open Swift
- When loaded, open Roblox

---

## Your system clock is incorrect

- Open **Settings ‚Üí Time & Language ‚Üí Date & Time**  
- Enable **Set Time Automatically**  
- Click **Sync Now**


> [!TIP]
> Still not syncing?
> Run [this](https://github.com/LilahCodes/swift/blob/main/support%20files/timesync.bat) file as admin to hopefully sync for you

---

## White screen

- Make sure you are running Swift as admin  
- Ensure your Windows account has admin privileges

---

## What VPN to use

> [!TIP]
> Warp by Cloudflare is free, simple, and works great with Swift.

- Download: [Warp VPN](https://1.1.1.1/)  
- Open it and enable "Cloudflare Warp"  
- [YouTube Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQHv5wnePS4)

## Not executing

SPAM the execute button, wait, spam more, wait, spam more.
Sometimes it just bugs out like that, if its still not executing then:

- Press `Win + R`, type: `%localappdata%`  
- Go to `Roblox/Versions`, delete **everything**
- Visit [rdd.latte.to](https://rdd.latte.to)  
    - Set Binary Type: `WindowsPlayer`  
    - Channel: `LIVE`  
    - Paste version number from downloaded zip
- Drag the zip into the versions folder  
- Remove `Live-WindowsPlayer-` from the filename  
- Extract & run Roblox from inside

Now Swift should execute properly.

## Crash on inject

- Make sure to inject in the home page of the **ROBLOX APP**, do **not** use the web version
- Download [roblox](https://www.roblox.com/download) again, you're probably using an outdated version
- If roblox just keeps launching an outdated version, use [this](https://github.com/LilahCodes/swift/blob/main/support%20files/roblox%20LIVE%20forcer.bat) tool to update for you
- Inject on the MENU and not in game
